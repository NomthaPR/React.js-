# React.js-
WHAT IS REACT.JS 

React.js is a javascript library application that creates interactive user interface(UI)
React.js creates a Virtual dom and also creates a copy of the virtual dom, any changes or manipulation that is made will not be made in the browser's dom, 
react.js will manipulate the virtual dom and after the changes has  been made on the virtual dom it then makes those changes to the browser's dom and will only change what is changed. 
Virtual dom is a javascript object that is virtual and it represents the real dom as the structure looks exacly like the real dom, but virtual dom is created by the React.js to execute 
changes in that virtual dom and then excute them on the real dom, making the application more faster and effective. 

WHAT MAKES REACT.JS TO BE FAST AND WHY USE REACT.JS
React.js creates a virtual dom from the actual dom, all the neccessary changes that needs to be made react will only execute those changes to the real dom
and then leave unneccessary changes that do not need to be executed. This helps to avoid dom manipulations overhead and creates more effeciancy eliminating time.
